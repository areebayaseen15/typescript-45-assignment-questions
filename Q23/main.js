/*Qno23:
Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:

let car = 'subaru';

console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")

console.log(car == 'subaru')

• Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.

• Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False.*/
// Test1:
let carr = "Subaru";
console.log(" Is he buying 'Subaru'? I predict true.");
console.log(carr == 'Subaru');
console.log(" Is he buying 'Toyota'? I predict false.");
console.log(carr == 'Toyota');
// Test2:
let age = 25;
console.log("\n Is age greater than 18? I predict True.");
console.log(age > 18);
console.log("\n Is age less than or equal to 30? I predict false.");
console.log(age <= 30);
// Test3:
let weather = "rainy";
console.log("\n Wil it rain? I predict true.");
console.log(weather == 'rainy');
console.log("\n Wil it snow? I predict false.");
console.log(weather == 'snow');
// Test4:
let fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];
console.log("\n Is 'apple' included in the fruits array? I predict True.");
console.log(fruits.includes('apple'));
console.log("\n Is 'grape' included in the fruits array? I predict False.");
console.log(fruits.includes('grape'));
// Test5:
let x = 5;
let y = 10;
console.log("\n Is x not equal to y? I predict True.");
console.log(x != y);
console.log("\n Is x greater than or equal to y? I predict False.");
console.log(x >= y);
