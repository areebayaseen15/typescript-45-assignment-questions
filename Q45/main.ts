// Qn045:Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object.
//  The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary 
//  number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value
//   pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the
//    information was stored correctly.


function storeCarInformation(manufacturer: string, model: string, ...options: [string, any][]) {
  let car: { [key: string]: any } = { manufacturer, model };
  options.forEach(([key, value]) => (car[key] = value));
  return car;
}

// Call the function with required information and additional name-value pairs
const carInfo = storeCarInformation("Toyota", "Corolla", ["color", "red"], ["year", 2020]);

// Print the object returned by the function
